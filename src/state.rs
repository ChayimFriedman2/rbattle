//! Module for the dynamic state of the game.
//!
//! This module defines the `State` type and its entourage. The data needed to
//! run an RBattle game is split into three categories:
//!
//! - `State` holds all the significant varying state of a game. What changes as the game proceeds
//!   are the amount of goop in each node, and the outflows the user has chosen;
//!   these are the `State`.
//!
//! - The positions of nodes and their boundaries and the locations of goop
//!   sources are all fixed, and are part of the `Map`.
//!
//! - Interface elements enter hover and active states as the user mouses
//!   around, but those states are ephemeral; they are part of the `Mouse` type.
//!   When the user actually completes an interaction with an interface element,
//!   only then is the `State` affected.
